    <h1>WanderSync: A Collaborative Travel Management System</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">CS 2340 - Group 31</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        WanderSync is a collaborative travel management system designed to make travel planning easier and more collaborative for all. This project aims to solve the problem of uniting complex information spanning multiple itineraries, reducing trip confusion, and making the trip planning process more productive and enjoyable.
    </p>

    <h2>Design & Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        WanderSync's architecture is built on a robust foundation of well-established design patterns and GRASP principles. Our sequence diagram illustrates the typical user workflow for adding accommodations, demonstrating how we've implemented a loop-based system that allows users to seamlessly add multiple accommodations while maintaining data consistency through our DatabaseManager.
    </p>

        <p class="diagram-caption">Figure 1: Sequence Diagram showing the Add Accommodation workflow</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The system's core functionality is distributed across several key classes, as shown in our Design Class Diagram. The User class serves as the central entity, connected to Itineraries, Accommodations, and Logistics. Each Destination contains essential attributes like travel dates, activities, and daily agendas, while the Logistics class handles trip statistics and contributor management.

    <h2>Conclusions and Reflections/Learning</h2>
    <p>
        For most of our group, this project represented our first comprehensive fullstack development experience. The learning curve throughout the semester was steep but rewarding, encompassing multiple aspects of modern software development:
    </p>

    <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
        <h3 style="color: #444;">Technical Skills Acquired</h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
            <li>Android Studio interface and Java programming</li>
            <li>Software design patterns (SOLID/GRASP principles, Singleton/Factory patterns)</li>
            <li>Agile methodology and sprint-based development</li>
            <li>Version control with Git and GitHub</li>
            <li>Firebase integration</li>
            <li>SonarQube implementation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
        <h3 style="color: #444;">Challenges and Growth</h3>
        <p>
            We encountered various challenges throughout the development process. Group organization required careful coordination of sprint contributions and effective communication between team members. The technical stack presented its own hurdles, as mobile app development was a new concept for many of us. Incorporating software engineering best practices and design principles added an extra layer of complexity to our learning journey.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Despite these challenges, seeing our fully deployed application come to life has been extremely rewarding. This experience has not only enhanced our technical capabilities but also taught us valuable lessons in user-centered design and collaborative development. We are proud of our achievements and grateful for the comprehensive learning experience this project has provided.
